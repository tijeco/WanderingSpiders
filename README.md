# WanderingSpiders
A suite of tools for ruining simulations to explore how venom toxicity evolves

## first we need to set up the spider

Mass (mg)

* spiderMassMin = 222.4
* spiderMassMax = 267.4

Caloric loss per day (cal/mg)
* calPerDayMin = 0.0112
* calPerDayMax = 0.1706 



## now we can set up the cricket



Mass (mg)

* cricketMin = 76.9
* cricketMax = 95.3
* cricketAssimilatedMin = 50.6
* cricketAssimilatedMax = 70.6

Caloric content (cal/mg)
* cricketCal = 6.17
